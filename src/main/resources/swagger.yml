      description: |-
        Retrieves the contextual risk reports status for a certain tenant.

        We consider status for all the reports (for all business contexts that
        have a related report). We don't keep a status for each business context.

        There are multiple states:

        get_report_status_state gets the state of the report as follow:
            1. No assets in scope (new tenant or the data was deleted)
            2. No required contexts:
                - To run the report, a context with devices should be present.
            3. Remediation Report is in progress -> add percentage and estimated time to completion
            4. An extend scan is currently running
            5. There are new changes in data, but the report isn't up to date and the job is not running yet.
            6. Report not generated -> when all the prerequisites are fulfilled but the task did not run ever.
            7. Are_assets_secure - No report should be load

        Security Check Subtest Serializer

        We use this because it is a bit complicated to have self-calling serializers.
        Because we only go 2 levels deep, it is easier to make a separate serializer
        for the model which omits the 'subtests' recursive key.
